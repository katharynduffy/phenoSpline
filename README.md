Smooths phenological time series iteratively using a bayesian information criterion (BIC) to determine optimal smoothing parameters and curve

The following are a series of functions adapted from Koen Huffken's phenocamR repository to integrate with PhenoCam's new API access.  This series of scripts avoids download of any data onto your computer, maintaning all analyses in the RStudio space via API.  

This series of scripts will be further adapted to process remotely sensed vegetation indicies from AppEEARS.

Repository initiated on October 3rd, 2018 by Katharyn Duffy.  Forks, pull requests and collaboration are welcome.
